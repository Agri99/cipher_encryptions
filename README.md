# 🔐 Cipher Encryptions (Caesar & Vigenère)

A simple Python CLI project that demonstrates two classic encryption algorithms:
- **Caesar Cipher**
- **Vigenère Cipher**

This project is built for learning purposes and understanding basic cryptography concepts.

> ⚠️ **Educational use only** — These ciphers are *not secure* and must not be used for real encryption.

---

## 🧰 Features
- Encrypt & decrypt using Caesar cipher
- Encrypt & decrypt using Vigenère cipher
- Interactive command-line interface
- Preserves spaces and punctuation

---

## 🖥️ Requirements
- Python **3.8+**
- No external libraries required

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python cipher_encrypt.py


## Example (Caesar):
Enter text to encrypt: Hello, World!
Enter shift (integer): 3
---Encrypted: Khoor, Zruog!


# Example (Vigenere):
Enter text to encrypt: Attack at dawn!
Enter Vigenere key (letters only): LEMON
---Encrypted: Lxfopv ef rnhr!
